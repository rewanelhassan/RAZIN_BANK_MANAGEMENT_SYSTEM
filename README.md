# Bank Management System (C++ OOP)

A comprehensive Financial Management System developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system manages multiple user roles (Clients, Employees, and Admins) with full data persistence through file handling. It features a secure login system, transaction management, and a hierarchical administrative structure.

## 🚀 Key Features:

* Role-Based Access Control: Distinct functionalities for Clients, Employees, and Admins.
* Data Persistence: Uses custom file handling to save and retrieve data (Clients, Employees, Admins, and IDs).
* OOP Principles: Implementation of Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
* Financial Operations: Secure deposit, withdrawal, and transfer operations between clients.
* Security: Password validation and basic encryption/decryption mechanisms.
* Manager Layer: Specialized manager classes (ClientManager, EmployeeManager, AdminManager) to handle console UI and logic separation.
* Singleton Pattern: Implemented in BankManager to ensure a single central authority for the system.

## 🛠 Technical Skills:

* Language: C++
* Concepts: OOP, STL (Vectors), File I/O, Static Members.
* Tools: Visual Studio, Git.

## 📁 Project Structure:
* Person.h / Person.cpp: The base class for all users.
* Client.h / Employee.h / Admin.h: Derived classes with specific roles.
* BankManager.h: The central authority of the system.
* Screens.h: Handles the console UI and application flow.
